# Car Project – Color Detection Sensor

This repository contains a project I developed during my second year, focused on building a **color detection sensor** for a  our line-following car. The project was created as part of a **line-following contest** which orgaized for our course.

## Project Overview
The color detection sensor is built using:
- **RGB LED** – to illuminate the track
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** – to measure reflected light and detect colors

Based on the analog values from the LDR, the system identifies different colors on the track and adjusts the car’s behavior accordingly.

In this repo only include only the color detection sensor codes noy fully functioal car's codes

## Features
- Detects and differentiates track colors using an RGB LED + LDR combination  
- Enables the car to follow a line based on color detection  
- Triggers a **buzzer** when specific colors are detected  
- Stops the car when a designated color is encountered  

## Contest Implementation
During the contest, the car:
- Followed colored lines using the sensor system  
- Counted specific color lines along the track  
- Activated a buzzer for detected colors  
- Stopped when a certain color was detected

🚗✨ This project demonstrates how simple hardware (RGB LED + LDR) can be used effectively in robotics and sensor-based systems.
